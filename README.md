# RatioDelta
An unknown but somewhat common arithmetic operation

In accounting, it is common to compute (a/b - 1), or (a/b - 1) * 100 if you want percents.
Following Knuth's advice "Name and conquer", we give the name ratio-delta to the binary operation a/b - 1.
We do know that Knuth can safely apply his advice, whilst for mere mortals the answer is mostly "Don't piss me off with your fancy name." ;)
