The translation of the SQL code in the 4 different dialects
was possible in one night only thanks to the help of Bing AI,
and the following websites to test and debug everything:

- <https://www.db-fiddle.com/>
- <https://onecompiler.com>

As usual, <https://stackoverflow.com> was also a key ingredient,
as is the documentation of the main DBMS.
